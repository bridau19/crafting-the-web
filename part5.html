              A picture of me, taken 4/28/1978 (6th grade).  I developed the
              film and printed the picture myself. Every Friday, there was a
              special class called “children’s choice”, and I chose to take
              photography class.  Back then, the class was less about taking
              pictures, but we used the darkroom to develop the film and make
              prints.

              Aug, 1971.  Me in a Model T Ford.   This car belonged to my Uncle
              George. He made the horse and buggy & doctor sculpture on our
              piano, and the accessories for my Fisher Price barn.

              He had a Model T?
            </p>
            <p>
              He had more than one! And a Model A as well. They had a lot of
              cars and old tractors (there were lots of small buildings and a
              big machine shed. Many of the buildings had a car inside. Often
              the upholstery was gone or mouse eaten, but a couple of the model
              T’s were restored. He used to drive them in parades).
